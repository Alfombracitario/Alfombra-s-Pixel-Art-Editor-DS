This is a pixel art editor developed specifically for the **Nintendo DS**.


The application is designed and tested to run on **original Nintendo DS hardware**. Emulator compatibility is **not guaranteed**, and emulator-specific issues are not a priority for this project.

This document describes the editor controls and the custom image format used by the application.

## 1. Controls

### General Controls
- **A** — Zoom in  
- **B** — Zoom out  
- **Y** or **R** — Enable / disable grid  
- **START** — Return to bitmap mode and **confirm changes**  
- **SELECT** — Return to bitmap mode and **cancel changes**

### Navigation

- **D-Pad** — Change active palette entry

## 2. ACS File Format

**`.acs` (Alfombra Compression System)** is a custom image format created to efficiently compress pixel art and allow **very fast loading times** on Nintendo DS hardware (and any other retro hardware!)

This format is currently **experimental**. While it is optimized for performance and memory usage, it may still contain edge cases or bugs. Use with caution, especially for important or production assets.
